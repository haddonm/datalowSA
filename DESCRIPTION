Description: datalowSA is a significant fork of the original simpleSA developed during
    FRDC project 2017/102 (Haddon et al., 2018), and it is a renamed version of the now
    deprecated humbleSA. The unused functions relating to 
    YPR are now removed. This version fixes up a bunch of typos in the catch_MSY 
    vignette and now includes functions for conducting age-structured stock 
    reduction analyses (not stochastic SRA, yet). Although, as yet, there is no vignette 
    describing its use. I will continue with its development slowly. This version on github
    now includes all the vignettes currently written.
