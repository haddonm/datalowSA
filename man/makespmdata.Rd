\title{makespmdata puts together correctly formatted data for SPM analysis}
\usage{
makespmdata(indata, yearcol = "year", catchcol = "catch",
  cpuecol = "cpue")
}
\arguments{
\item{indata}{either the list obtained from readdata or the data.frame 'fish'
from with the list obtained from readdata. Alternatively a simple matrix
containing at least vectors of year, catch, and cpue with those column
headings.}

\item{yearcol}{the column name of the column containng the years}

\item{catchcol}{the column name of the column containng the catch data}

\item{cpuecol}{the column name of the column containng the cpue data}
}
\value{
a matrix of class 'spmdat', which has the correct formatting for
    use with the spm related functions in datalowSA
}
\description{
makespmdata takes an input data set and out of it puts together
    the three vectors of the years, the catch, and the CPUE, in that order,
    to be analysed using surplus production modelling. The output matrixc is
    put into a suitable format, having column headings 'year', 'catch', and
    'cpue' and gives it the class spmdat (which has a plot method).
