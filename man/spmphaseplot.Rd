\title{spmphaseplot - plots the phase plot of harvest rate vs biomass}
\usage{
spmphaseplot(
  answer,
  Blim = 0.2,
  Btarg = 0.5,
  filename = "",
  resol = 200,
  fnt = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{answer}{the object output by the function displayModel, containing the
production curve, the fishery dynamics (predicted harvest rate and 
biomass through time).}

\item{Blim}{the limit reference point, defaults to 0.2 so that 0.2B0 is used.}

\item{Btarg}{what target reference point will be used in the phase plot. A 
default of 0.5 is used.}

\item{filename}{default is empty. If a filename is put here a .png file
with that name will be put into the working directory.}

\item{resol}{the resolution of the png file, defaults to 200 dpi}

\item{fnt}{the font used in the plot and axes. Default=7, bold Times. Using
6 gives Times, 1 will give SansSerif, 2 = bold Sans}
}
\value{
an invisible list of B0, Bmsy, Hmsy, and Hlim.

\description{
spmphaseplot uses the output from displayModel to plot up 
    the phase plot of harvest rate vs Biomass, marked with the limit and
    default targets. It identifies the start and end years (green and red
    dots) and permits the stock status to be determined visually. It also 
    plots out the catch time-series and harvest rate time-series to aid in
    interpretation of the phase plot.
