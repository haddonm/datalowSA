\description{
readdata reads in a standard format data file. An example of the
    standard format is generated by using the function dataTemplate, which
    generates an example datafile which can be used to demonstrate the
    methods present in datalowSA, or can be used as a template to edit and
    input a new or different dataset.

\examples{
\dontrun{
dataTemplate(filename="test.csv", title="A test of the functions")
ans <- readdata("test.csv",property=FALSE)
str(ans)
}             # filename="sardine.csv";
