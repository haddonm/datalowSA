\title{plotlag plots the effect of a lag between two variables}
\usage{
plotlag(
  x,
  driver = "catch",
  react = "cpue",
  lag = 0,
  interval = "year",
  filename = "",
  resol = 200,
  fnt = 7
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the matrix containing columns of the named variables. It must
contain columns with the same names as the driver and react(ing) 
variables}

\item{driver}{the variable doing the influencing}

\item{react}{the variable being influenced}

\item{lag}{the time lag before the influence is felt}

\item{interval}{the name of the time-interval variable, default='year'}

\item{filename}{default is empty. If a filename is put here a .png file
with that name will be put into the working directory.}

\item{resol}{the resolution of the png file, defaults to 200 dpi}

\item{fnt}{the font used in the plot and axes. Default=7, bold Times. Using
6 gives Times, 1 will give SansSerif, 2 = bold Sans}
}
\value{
a list containing some summary results, the anova of the linear 
    model fitted in aov, and a summary of the linear model in summ
}
\description{
the use of the function ccf can suggest a lagged relationship
    between a driver variable and a react(ing) variable. For example, cpue
    may respond to catches in a negative manner after a lag of a few years.
    One looks for a negative lag, which would imply that the driver variable
    influences the react(ing) variable after the given lag has passed. The 
    lag is always assumed to be based on yearly intervals, though this can
    be changed.
