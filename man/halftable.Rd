\title{halftable halves the height of a tall narrow data.frame}
\usage{
halftable(inmat, yearcol = "Year", subdiv = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{inmat}{the data.frame to be subdivided}

\item{yearcol}{the column name of the year field}

\item{subdiv}{the number of times the data.frame should be subdivided;
the default is 3 but the numbers can only be 2 or 3.}
}
\value{
a data.frame half the height and double the width of the original
}
\description{
halftable would be used when printing a table using kable
    from knitr where one of the columns was Year. The objective would be to
    split the table in half taking the bottom half and attaching it on
    the right hand side of the top half. The year column would act as the
    index.

\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- as.data.frame(matrix(runif(80),nrow=20,ncol=4))
x[,1] <- 1986:2005
x[,4] <- paste0("text",1:20)
halftable(x,yearcol="V1",subdiv=2)
halftable(x[,c(1,2,4)],yearcol="V1")
x1 <- rbind(x,x[1,])
x1[21,"V1"] <- 2006
halftable(x1,yearcol="V1",subdiv=3)
