\title{bootspm conducts a bootstrap analysis on a spm model}
\usage{
bootspm(optpar, fishery, iter = 100, schaefer = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{optpar}{The optimum model parameters from an earlier analysis}

\item{fishery}{the fishery data containing the original observed cpue values}

\item{iter}{the number of boostrap replicates to be run}

\item{schaefer}{default is TRUE, determines whether a Schaefer or a Fox model
is run}
}
\value{
a list of two matrices. One contining the bootstrap parameters and 
    the other containing some of the dynamics, including the ModelB, the 
    bootstrap CPUE sample, the Depletion, and the annual harvest rate.
}
\description{
bootspm conducts a bootstrap analysis on a spm model. It does 
    this by saving the original fishery data, estimating the cpue residuals,
    and multiplying the optimum predicted CPUE by a bootstrap sample of the
    log-normal residuals (Haddon, 2011, p311). This bootstrap sample of CPUE
    replaces the original fish[,"cpue"] and the model is re-fitted. This is 
    repeated iter times and the outputs reported ready for the derivation of
    percentile confidence intervals. The optimum solution is used as the 
    first bootstrap replicate (it is standard practice to include the 
    original fit in the bootstrap analysis). If 1000 replicates are run this
    procedure can take a couple of minutes on a reasonably fast computer. A
    comparison of the mean with the median should provide some notion of any
    bias in the mean estimate.
